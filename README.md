Yes, I love a good cup of coffee ☕ ... but lately, I've been obsessed with a new question: 'What can I learn today to bring me one step closer to my dream job as a developer?' 🤔🚀

As a lifelong lover of languages, I'm fascinated by phonetics, writing systems, and now, the languages of the web! 💻

I've always enjoyed the challenge of making things better, whether it's proofreading a manuscript 📝, ensuring foreign scripts are typeset on a page correctly 🔤, or helping non-native speakers improve their English 🗣️. But lately, I've been dreaming bigger. What if I could design interactive apps? 🤔 Or even create tools that empower others? 💪

That's why I took the leap into coding 👩‍💻. Now, my days are filled with learning new languages, connecting the dots between tech concepts, and imagining all the incredible things I'll be able to create. 

I am just a coder-in-training 🌱, but I'm excited to combine my love of language with this newfound passion.  

So let's connect over a virtual americano ☕ and chat about all the possibilities that await as I brew my future in code! 😊

P.S. Tea lovers welcome too! 🍵
