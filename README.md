Hey, it's nice to have you here!

I'm passionate about learning new things, especially when it comes to my dream job as a developer.  

I have a background in languages and enjoy improvement, whether it's through proofreading or teaching English.

Recently, I've started learning to code and I'm excited to combine my love of language with this new skill. 

👩‍💻 I'm eager to connect with experienced developers like you and learn more about the industry.

Let's connect over a virtual coffee (or tea!) ☕🍵 and chat about your experience in tech as I brew my future in code!

Take care!
